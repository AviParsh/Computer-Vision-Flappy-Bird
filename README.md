# Computer-Vision-Flappy-Bird
A flappy bird game which is playable by simply closing your fist to make the bird fly and opening it to let it fall. When the program is first run, it will ask for camera access and file access. After you accept these requests, run the program again to start the game. The camera is most accurate at detecting a closed palm when there is a solid background behind it.
All code is in the folder called SFML Template. Code for the game part of this application was created with the help of a UDemy course taught by Frahaan Hussein.
